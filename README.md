# Rona's IoT Documentation
This document includes information on Rona's IoT Project that involves Arduino, Atlas Scientific Sensors, and Node-Red. All code in the repositories are labeled accordingly. 


## General Notes

Atlas Scientific sensors and other sensors are used.
Sensors are coded using Arduino/C++.
Node-Red is used to manipulate data.

To use multiple Atlas Scientific Sensors, a Whitebox Labs Tentacle Shield is used.
